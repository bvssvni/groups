 I am using QuickSort to sort data, but I had to adapt the algorithm
 for doing general sorting. Here is the original algorithm for
 controlling if you suspect it is anything wrong with the sorting.
 
 void swap(int *a, int *b)
 {
 int t=*a; *a=*b; *b=t;
 }
 void sort(int arr[], int beg, int end)
 {
 if (end > beg + 1)
 {
 int piv = arr[beg], l = beg + 1, r = end;
 while (l < r)
 {
 if (arr[l] <= piv)
 l++;
 else
 swap(&arr[l], &arr[--r]);
 }
 swap(&arr[--l], &arr[beg]);
 sort(arr, beg, l);
 sort(arr, r, end);
 }
 }
