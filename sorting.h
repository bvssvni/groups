		Uses QuickSort to sort data pointed by an array.
		
		arr	The array of pointers to the data to sort.
			The data must start with gcstac_item (not pointer)
			in the beginning of the struct.
		
		beg	The first index to start sorting.
		
		end	The index after the last position in 
			the array to sort.
			Typically you can just set this to the
			'length' of the array.
	
		stride	The size of each block of data.
			This is used to swap the content of the
			of the data. The sorting algorithm
			does not swap pointers, so the data can be sorted
			in the buffer where they are stored.
			This means you can 'sort' to remove fragmentations.
		
		t	A temporary buffer for swapping at 
			the size of the stride.
	
		compare	The function to compare.
				Returns a < b	->	-1
					a > b	->	1
					a = b	->	0
